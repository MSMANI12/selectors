	     <h2>indian cricket history</h2>
		 <p>Cricket grew out of the many stick-and-ball games played in England
           500 years ago, under a variety of different rules. The word ‘bat’ is an old
           English word that simply means stick or club. By the seventeenth century,
           cricket had evolved enough to be recognisable as a distinct game and it
           was popular enough for its fans to be fined for playing it on Sunday
           instead of going to church.</p>

		  <h2>lion</h2>
		  <p>Lions live in groups that are called prides.
		  10 to 40 lions may live in a pride.
		  Each pride has a home area that is called its territory.
		  Lions do not allow other carnivores (meat-eating animals) to hunt in their territory.
		  A territory can be as large as 260 square kilometres (100 square miles).</p>

		  <h2>tiger</h2>
		  <p>Linnaeus's scientific description of the tiger was based on descriptions by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi.
		  [2] Bengal tiger skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London vary from light yellow to reddish yellow with black stripes.
		  The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
		  It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.
		  An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. 
		  It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator,
		  requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.</p>
